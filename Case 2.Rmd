##DATA CLEANING 

#######################################################
### Undercutting ALLSTATE online Case
###
###
### Load additional file to install packages- Please chose the DataAnlyticsFunction.R file
source(file.choose())
###
###
### Load ALLSTATE DATA FILE - Please load the ALLSTATE csv file
ALLcost <- read.csv(file.choose())

### Data Preparation ###########################
################################################
###
### Lets see a summary of it
###
summary(ALLcost)
### there are plenty of things to decide here.
### Which variables have NA's:
### risk_factor also has NA (that should be also a level)
### duration_previous it has 0 and NA's we probably need to treat them differently.
### C_previous
### location
### 
### Lets print the first 6 data points
ALLcost[1:6,]
### we see that the first customer requested 2 quotes
### if we are predicting the behavior of the customer, we should take that in consideration
### but first we will predict the cost quoted by ALLSTATE
### so we start by assuming it does not discriminate across used id and shopping_pt (an assumption)
drop <- c("customer_ID","shopping_pt","record_type","time","location")
### This creates a dataframe (DATA) from d without the columns in drops
DATA <- ALLcost[,!(names(ALLcost) %in% drop)]
###
DATA$car_value <-  factor(DATA$car_value)
DATA$day <-  factor(DATA$day)
DATA$state <-  factor(DATA$state)
duration_NA <-  ifelse( is.na(DATA$duration_previous) , 1, 0 )        ### creating a dummy variable for NA
### number of NA in duration
sum(duration_NA)
### corresponds to 5% of the sample 783/15483
sum(duration_NA)/length(duration_NA)
### It is not that big and we could just drop them in a first analysis
### however we wil create a dummy variable
DATA$duration_previous[duration_NA>0] <-0 ### making NA to zero
### lets look at C_previous
C_NA <-  ifelse( is.na(DATA$C_previous), 1, 0 )        ### creating a dummy variable for NA
### how many?
sum(C_NA)
### very suspecious...
cor(C_NA,duration_NA)
### HAHA... the same observations that do not report previous duration...
### Lets treat C_previous as factor
DATA$C_previous[C_NA>0] <-0 ### making NA to zero
DATA$C_previous <-  factor(DATA$C_previous)                           
### Lets look at risk_factor as well...
risk_NA <- ifelse( is.na(DATA$risk_factor), 1, 0 )
sum(risk_NA)
### The NA for those are different observations...
DATA$risk_factor[risk_NA>0] <-0                     
### treat thatas a level "0" (a new category of risk...)
DATA$risk_factor <-  factor(DATA$risk_factor)                           
###
DATA$homeowner <-  factor(DATA$homeowner)
DATA$married_couple <-  factor(DATA$married_couple)
summary(DATA)
### there should be no NA's in the data at this point....

##Plotting age of Oldest Person in the Policy VS Mean Cost of Quote

a = c()
a_levels = c(18:75)

for (x in 18:75) {
  a = rbind(a,mean(DATA$cost[DATA$age_oldest==x]))
  print(mean(DATA$cost[DATA$age_oldest == x], na.rm = TRUE))
}

##Please refer to the inference of this plot in the pdf

##Plotting age of Youngest Person in the Policy VS Mean Cost of Quote

library("ggplot2")
plot(a_levels,a,col="cornflowerblue", pch =16, main="The Mean Quote Prices vs Age of the Oldest Person on the Policy", xlab = "Age of the Oldest Person in the group on the Insurance Policy", ylab="Mean Cost per Age")
abline(lm(a~a_levels), col = "navyblue")

b = c()
b_levels = c(18:75)

for (x in 18:75) {
  b = rbind(b,mean(DATA$cost[DATA$age_youngest==x]))
  print(mean(DATA$cost[DATA$age_youngest == x], na.rm = TRUE))

#### Question 2: A first linear Regression Model. 
####             Feel free to use this or improve upon it.
#### this is a linear regression with all the variables in DATA
result <- glm(cost ~ ., data = DATA) 
### and to see the results (coefficients, p-values, etc...)
summary(result)
### the R-squared in this case is 
1 - (result$dev/result$null)

### As a side note, note that when running regressions, 
### sometimes R creates new columns automatically to run the regression
### for example, it creates dummies for you if you have columns that are
### factors. To get matrix with all these columns explicitly created 
### for the following regression
result <- glm(cost ~ ., data = DATA)
### simply use the command "model.matrix" as follows
M <- model.matrix(cost~., data = DATA)
summary(M)
### thus the same regression can be run as
resultM <- glm(DATA$cost ~ M)
### Just to make sure, lets see that R2 match...
1 - (resultM$dev/resultM$null)
###
### By having the design matrix you can easily drop or add variables
### based on any rule you like to use.
### For example, if you want to use only the first 5 columns of M
### you simple call with M[,1:5]
resultM5 <- glm(DATA$cost ~ M[,1:5])

#### Another model one can consider is the one that 
#### would include interactions based 
#### on the the coverage options A through G
#### we can add those interactions in addition to the previous variables
result_interactions <- glm(cost ~ .+(A+B+C+D+E+F+G)^2, data = DATA) 
#### this has all the variables plus all the interations 

summary(result_interactions)

##Dropping the variables that are not significant and choosing the model for our regression

my_model2<- glm(cost~ homeowner + car_age + car_value+ risk_factor+ age_oldest+ age_youngest + married_couple + C_previous + duration_previous +(A+B+C+D+E+F+G)^2, data = DATA)
summary(my_model2)

##Predictions done below

```


```{r}
#################################
#### Questions 3 is conceptual questions about modeling framework.
#### No data analysis expected.
## We have used the following code to make our forecasts 
forecast<- predict(my_model2, newdata=DATA, interval="prediction")
comparison<-data.frame(DATA$cost,forecast3)

##Writing all the values into an excel file.
library(writexl)
##Please provide a path where the excel can be saved. 
write_xlsx(comparison,"/Users/riddhimab/Downloads/Data Science/comparison_new.xlsx")

##We have attached our own excel sheet with further calculations on canvas.

```

### Question 4 Provide quotes for new.customers
#################################

## The following command loads the "new.customers" to memory
## it is already formatted in our conventions 
## (where NA's in some variables were turned to level "0")
new.customers <- readRDS("NewCustomers.Rda")

print("Competitiors Prediction")
predict (result, newdata = new.customers)

print("Our Prediction")

##Using the model of the team to predict the quote costs for the "new customers"
predict(my_model2, newdata= new.customers)

```

```{r}
#################################
#### Question 5: No start script
## We want to determine the effect that the "risk_factor" variable has on the cost. 
## Hence we have plotted the two as a boxplot
plot(DATA$risk_factor,DATA$cost, col="cornflowerblue", pch =16, 
     main="Cost Distribution of Different Risk Factors", xlab = "Risk Factors", ylab="Cost")

## We see that the boxplot shows no relation betweeen the quote price to the customer with the risk level. Hence, we have assumed that since this is a significant variable, it affects the customers cost to company/ liklihood of them claiming their insurance.

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
