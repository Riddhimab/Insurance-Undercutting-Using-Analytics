# Insurance-Undercutting-Using-Analytics

In most industries, costs of inputs can be used to calculate a profitable price to charge for a product. In 
the  insurance  industry,  their  product  is  the  “insurance  policy”,  and  the  largest  input  is  the  cost  of  
“claims”  their  customers  file  when  they  get  into  an  accident.  These  costs  are  difficult  to  calculate  for  
two  reasons.  First, they vary  by  customer;  some  customers  have  multiple  claims  over  the  life  of their  
policy,  others  have  none.  Second,  the  total  cost  of  the  claims  is  not  known  until  after  an  accident  
occurs, which is well after the policy has been priced and sold to the customer. 
 
However,  segments  of  customers  may  be  more  likely  to  cause  accidents  the  other  (e.g.  young  males  
are much riskier than middle-aged females) leading insurance companies to charge different prices to 
various  groups  to  “out-segment”  their  competitors  leading  to  adverse  selection  for  the  competitors  
who end up with a large number of high-risk and claim-prone customers. 
 
Insurance  companies  tightly  guard  the  algorithms  that  they  use  to  price  the  policies  of  individual  
customers,  but  if  we  could  provide  a  policy  quote  after  observing  our  competitors  quote,  this  would 
allow for an “instantaneous last mover” advantage. 
 
Several  sites  provide  services  of  comparing  quote  and  considerable  variability  is  observed  between  
competitors.  At  that  point  it  is  already  too  late  to  update  your  quote.  (Additional  legal  issues  further 
complicate trying to craw competitors’ websites in real time.) Therefore, if we can predict competitors’ 
(dynamic) quotes we can base our quote on those as well.  
 
You  were  approached  by  an  auto  insurance  company,  which  was  interested  in  pursuing  such  idea 
based  on  analytics.  They  ask  you  to  conduct  a  pilot  study,  comment  on  the  feasibility  of  the  project,  
and potential next steps. 
Moving Forward  
As the starting point, a data file containing the information of 15,484 quotes of an online competitor 
(ALLSTATE) was provided. The file contains information about the policy offered, information on the 
customer, and the quoted price (see Exhibit 1 below for a description). As a last reminder to potentially 
help your modelling, the manager discussed with you how prices are typically quoted in the insurance 
industry. In particular he stressed that many features appear as add-on prices.
